GL:

 * more GL object primitives: ~~line~~, ~~sphere~~, pyramid
 * Collect ideas/implement Flowskell.Lib.Glitch (distortion effects, etc)
 * ~~Textures~~
 * ~~Shaders! (local and global (glow, blur)) http://wiki.delphigl.com/index.php/Shadersammlung~~
 * ~~Read http://www.arcadianvisions.com/blog/?p=224~~
 * ~~make-grid command or so to show the axis (RGB=XYZ) (can be called at top level or after a specific transformation)~~
 * Look into performance issues (allocating texture, depth buffer, render-to-texture)
 * ~~Fonts? using simple glut fonts for now~~
 * ~~Option to enforce viewport width/height~~
 * Ability to change post shader (currently blur) or use multiple post shaders (yay!)
    * swirl shader: http://www.geeks3d.com/20110428/shader-library-swirl-post-processing-filter-in-glsl/
 * Ability to move light source
 * Ability to add texture to sphere and make earth.scm example
    * Probably like this:
       glHint(GL_PERSPECTIVE_CORRECTION_HINT, GL_NICEST);
       glNewList(list[0], GL_COMPILE);
       sphere = gluNewQuadric();
       gluQuadricDrawStyle( sphere, GLU_FILL);
       gluQuadricNormals( sphere, GLU_SMOOTH);
       gluQuadricOrientation( sphere, GLU_OUTSIDE);
       gluQuadricTexture( sphere, GL_TRUE);


Scheme:

 * ~~unify (vector 0 0 0) stuff, then implement HSV coloring~~
 * ~~implement vector functions like vmul, vadd, ...~~
 * ~~fix float error~~
 * scheme compilation to Haskell AST instead of evaluation
 * ~~use fluxus-like (every-frame ...) instead of current (define (every-frame) ...)~~
 * memoize stuff like secs, msecs so that 1) they stay the same for each frame, 2) evaluation is faster due to lazyness
 * maybe add an option to modify lisp tree randomly and use genetic algorithm to weight results (fitness=variance of the output or so)
 * Add (with-color), (with-texture), (with-shader), (preserve-matrix), as (push) ... (pop) is not very Lisp like

Viewer:

 * ~~be able to rotate top level with mouse~~ and cursor keys
 * mouse wheel should be zoom
 * optional code, ~~fps display~~
 * REPL
     * Bugfix: Do not write to REPL when it is hidden
     * Bugfix: Fix encoding in REPL
     * Funky cursor in REPL instead of pipe
 * Code (re)loading
     * ~~live code reloading, and fix F5 code reloading first~~
     * ~~Bugfix: Code reloading: do not crash when source does not exist anymore~~
     * Remember path to all shader sources, and also do a reload of these
     * ~~+ more robust error handling (do not exit on Scheme error, or better yet: rewind to old environment)~~
     * Do not exit on GLSL error
 * Keys
     * ~~F1: show help~~
     * ~~F2: toggle REPL~~
     * ~~F3: toggle fps~~
     * F4: toggle source
     * ~~F5: source reload~~
     * ~~F6: reset view matrix~~
     * ~~F7: screenshot~~
     * F11: fullscreen
     * ?: Skip through presets/examples

Input:
 * Audio
     * ~~implement Jack capture~~
     * make Jack audio input stable
     * fourier analysis/harmonic analysis
 * MIDI
 * Keyboard

Testing:
 * Write tests for Scheme functions
 * Write functionality that verifies that no example contains errors
 * Write a stress test
